Cash Register

A Web Application for shopkeepers to determine a way to return change with minimum amount of notes. The app takes the following inputs :-

1) Bill amount.
2) Cash amount.

The app calculates the difference and shows how many of each of the available notes need to be returned in order to settle the due, 
only if the cash amount is greater than the bill amount. Else, it shows an error message.
